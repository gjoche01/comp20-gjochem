A README for lab 4

1. What has been done correctly: I think that the whole assignemnt has been done correctly. I tested each requirement 

2. I collaborated with Sophie Maki to talk about the lab. I also got help from Sophie Dassinger, the TA when I was confused about how the coordinates worked in the sprite

3. I spent approximatly an hour reading the pages linked and others to figure out how CSS can change the photos on the page with changing screen size. It then took about half an hour to code the CSS file correctly as the instructions asked.
