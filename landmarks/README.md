1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
I think that all aspects are correct. One thing that I hard coded was I made the inital "me" lat
lng to be the same as Tufts before I get it. Origianlly I had my lat lng at 0,0 in the beginning
but then the map is loaded for a few seconds at 0,0 (middle of the ocean) while the other 
data is being loaded. But if I make the "me" coordinates the same as Tufts, then this issues is avoided. 

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
I discuessed the assignemnt with Sophie Maki. I also got got help from TAs, like 
Elliot, Ryan Havens, and Derek Benson. 

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
I spent approximatly 8 hours on this project.
