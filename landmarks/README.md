1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
I think that all aspects are correct. One thing that I hard coded was the center
of the map. I hard coded it as tufts coordiantes as that is the focus of this assignment. 
But, if for some reason everyone in the class went somewhere totally different, then 
that center would not be the best. 

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
I discuessed the assignemnt with Sophie Maki. I also got got help from TAs, like 
Elliot, Ryan Havens, and Derek Benson. 

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
I spent approximatly 8 hours on this project.
