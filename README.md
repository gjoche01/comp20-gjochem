1. PURPOSE
To summarize and reflect on my learning from comp 20. 

2. FAVORITE LAB OR ASSIGNMENT 
I really liked working on assignment 2. It was cool to do work that was so visual. 
I also liked it becuase it required some algrotihmic and what I think 
of as traditional coding thinking, but you can see the results quickly and clearly 
on screen as opposed to a C program. 

3. GROWTH 
I think I have grown a lot in this class. A big takeaway for me was learning 
how to learn. 

4. 2 IMPORTANT THINGS
Reading APIs and looking up examples online to help was also a 
key skill that will be useful in the future. 
Also, I learned the basics of how the web actually works!


5. DELVE DEEPER INTO?
I'm really intersted in using the web with journalism. For example, presenting stories
on a website, or creating interactive graphics, or finding other ways to display a 
story digitally. This is something I'm hoping to work more on.
